# longji

Longji lets you specify which namespaces are allowed to use functions
from a given namespace and warns you if that constraint is violated.

Longji can help enforce a layered approach to project design.

## Usage

= 

(ns foo.bar
 {:only-from [a.b #"^x"]})

= 

> lein longji foo.bar

=

will warn you if any namespaces besides a.b and namespaces starting
with x refer to vars from foo.bar.

=

Warning: foo.bar used from x.y

=

> lein longji

=

will check all namespaces in the project source-path
